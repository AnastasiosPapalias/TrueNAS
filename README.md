**TrueNAS Scale - 🐚 Shell Seeker**

This repository contains my comprehensive documentation, guides, and configurations for TrueNAS Scale deployments in homelab environments. Here you'll find detailed instructions for setup, optimization techniques, network hardening procedures, and various tips and tricks I've discovered along my TrueNAS journey.

> :warning: TrueNAS Scale is actively developed and features may change over time. While I strive to keep this documentation current with the latest releases, there might occasionally be discrepancies between these guides and the most recent software version.

I've created these resources to help fellow homelab enthusiasts and IT professionals implement robust TrueNAS Scale solutions. Feel free to adapt these configurations to your specific requirements.
